# GeckoCodes.org

An unofficial project aiming at creating a `static` version of this mythical website.

Link : https://a-blondel.github.io/geckocodes.org/

## Features

The original goal was only to bring back the *Button Conditional* page, but given the pretty design and that most of the site can work statically then more features will be supported over time.

Feel free to open an issue for any feature request.

Please note that the only source of truth concerning codes is https://gamehacking.org/

My modest contribution is to making it static.
